<div id="descriptions">
<h1 id="prefrontal">The Frontal Lobe</h1>
 <h6>FUNCTION: PLANNING, ORGANIZING, PROBLEM SOLVING, ATTENTION, PERSONALITY, EMOTIONS, BEHAVIOR
</h6>
<p>You're frontal lobe is involved in the primary planning, control, and execution of all voluntary movements. It's divided into three parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Premotor Cortex: in charge of of sensory movememnt and control</li>
  <li>Supplementary Motor Area: plans movememnts and coordination</li>
  <li>Primary Motor Cortex: sends information down through your spinal cord in orderto move different parts of the body.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>"Knowledge is power”- Each time we learn a new skill we also create new ways of engaging our brain and develop motor skills. The more we exercise our brain the more powerful it becomes.</p>

<h1 id="temporal-lobe">The Temporal Lobe</h1>
 <h6>FUNCTION: PROCESSING AND STORING NEW INFORMATION INTO LONG TERM MEMORY
</h6>
<p>The Temporal Lobes sort process new information and sort them into our memories. They take in our emotions and we use them to comprehend language, personality, human behvaior, and emotions.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">The Amygdala: "processing center for fear” - MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences
</p>
<p>The Amygdala is located insite the temporal loves and it separates our good and bad feelings and emotions.</p>

<h1 id="brainstem">The Brainstem</h1>
 <h6>FUNCTION: REGULATES OUR CARDIOVASCULAR, BODILY FUNCTIONS AND OUR CONSCIOUSNESS
</h6>
<p>The Brainstem regulates our heart rate, breath circulation, eating, sleeping, and our whole cardiovascular system control. It is our main conscious and controls our alertness, awareness,and sensitivities.</p>
 
 <p>It helps set our daily routines and cycles.
</p>

<h1 id="parietal-lobe">The Parietal Lobe</h1>
 <h6>FUNCTION: RECEIVES INFORMATION FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND TURNS ON OUR SENSORY SYSTEM
</h6>
<p>The parietal Lobe uses our senses to analyze information from the outside world. It also uses our skin and nerves to detect sensory information.</p>

<h1>The Cerebellum</h1>
 <h6>FUNCTION: COORDINATES MOVEMENTS AND MUSCLES AND MAKES MOST OF OUR DECISIONS
</h6>
<p>The Cerebellum makes our decisions and forms our thoughts. It analyzes new information that we learn.</p>
<p>It is why we are able to do the tasks we do based on our emotions and decisions (ex: self-care tasks when we are stressed).</p>

<!--<h1>The Occipital Lobe</h1>
 <h6>FUNCTION: VISUAL RECEPTION AND INTERPRETATION

<h4 style="text-align: center"> Approximately 1 in 6 U.S. youth ages 6-17 experience a mental health disorder each year, and 1 in 5 adults. -National Alliance On Mental Health</h4>
<h4 style="font-style: italic;">But according to Mission Harbor Behavioral Health, a mental health treatment organization in California, many people find it difficult to perform self-care, due to fatigue, hopelessness or 'guilt for indulging in something pleasurable'.</h4>

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Neuroplasticity is the way the brain is constantly reorganizing, developing, and changing itself according to your actions and environmental factors. What you think, feel, and behave like plays a huge rule in impacting your neuroplasticity and how your brain grows with you.</p>
<p>Anxiety, depression, and many mental health issues stem from NEGATIVE neuroplasticity: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Formed by the bad habits and conscious awareness your brain has developed. Each time you act a certain way a neuron pattern is called and strengthened, so breaking your bad habits becomes harder as they strengthen and take charge over your brain power. Ex: staring at a screen for many hours a day.</p>
  </li>

  <p>Positive neuroplasticity can be the solution to  helping your brain drive back into ’normal’ and overcome the depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. The brain is extremely powerful; we just need to be fueling it with the right actions and habits. </p>
<h3 style="font-weight:normal">Self care is essentially driving the brain’s positive neuroplasticity and helping it gain control over the negative. This is why you are in charge of your mental health and you have the power to help yourself.</h3>
