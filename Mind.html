    <h2 style="text-align: center">The 3 Simple Ways To Fuel Your Brain</h2>
    <h4>1. Routines and Habits<h4>
      <p style="font-weight:normal">I'm sure you've heard the saying, 'humans are creatures of habits'. Well it's very true- from the day we learned to walk, we have relied on these routines and habits to shape our day to day lives and give them structure. We depend on these routines to keep us on track and to help us develop key individual characterists. Often times, we forget how important it is to build routines and how much we rely on even the smallest of habits.</p> 
         <ul>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">They help minimize uncertainity, which allows us to clear out any fear of uncertainty which is processed through our <a href="./BrainInteractive.html#temporal-lobe">amygdala</a>. Further, this guides our sense of control and mental clarity.</p>
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">‘Make space’ in our <a href="./BrainInteractive.html#prefrontal">prefrontal cortex</a>- the part of our brain involved in most all planning and thinking- by allowing our minds to store routines as habits rather than new information.
           </p>
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Allows us to work on relationships, new tasks, development. This conserves our energy for important things throughout the day</p></li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Helps us focus and be more attentive.
           </p>
           </li>
           </ul>

     <h4>2. Productivity and Learning<h4>
      <p style="font-weight:normal">Productivity is different than working long hours and feeling stressed- you should focus on engaging and positively challenging your mind and the part of your brain involved in thinking, developing skills, and analyzing. To make it easier to understand, let's divide the fundamentals of productivity and the impact of it on our mental health into 3 sections:</p> 
         <ol>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">DOPAMINE / The 'Fun': Dopamine is a feel-good neurotransmitter; it's released when we do things that give us pleasure or satisfaction.
           </p>
           <p style="font-weight:normal">It's important to find balance between having fun without distractions. One way we can do this and raise our dopamine levels is by rewarding ourselves at the end of period of productivity or brain-engageming activity.</p>
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">NORADRENALINE / 'Fear': released when series of stressful changes or events activated an area of the <a href="./BrainInteractive.html#brainstem">brainstem</a>, leading to either euphoria or anxiety and panic attacks.
           </p>
           <p style="font-weight:normal">The right amount of fear increases levels of noradrenaline, also increasing productivity. For example, you can create and set goals that allow you to get out of your comfort zone. This would create the right amount of pressure which is benefecial to your self-esteem and character-development. </p>
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">ACETYLCHOLINE / 'Focus': in charge of contracting muscles, dilating blood vessels, bodily excretion, heart rate, and more necessary functions.</p>
           <p style="font-weight:normal"> For increased focus and productivity, we our brain needs higher levels of acetylcholine to remain stable and calm.</p>
            <p style="font-weight:normal">Some ways to give our brain these needs is by eating foods rich in choline: milk, yogurt, beans, peas, broccoli. Another way we could do this is with gentle exercise and even simply creating an environment that encourages us to  stay focused.</p></li>
          </ol>
