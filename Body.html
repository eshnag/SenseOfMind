    <h3>1. Exercise & Movement</h3>
      <p style="font-weight:normal">Exercise feeds the brain, releases endorphins and boosts our moods. It ensures proper brain function in the hippocampus region of <a href="./BrainInteractive.html#temporal-lobe">temporal lobe</a>, involved in forming memories and emotional regulation of these memories. Excercise and regular physical activity can change the size of this region of our brains involved in memory and learning.</p> 
         <ul>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Physical exercise and movement allows the brain to gain control of our body and environment. </p>
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Our brain is navigating the activity of the rest of our organs and body parts, which gives us a sense of influence over our surroundings.
           </p>
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">When we’re under stress, our mind wants to close in on itself- sometimes activating its flight-or-fight response- due to environmental triggers and this makes us feel out of control. A good way reducing stress, therefore, is  stretching: this opens the body during stress,when your brain starts to close in and become anxious.</p></li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Regular exercise leads to better concentration and dedication, and leads to making better decisions throughout the day.
           </p>
           </li>
           </ul>

      <p>Best excercises for the brain and mental health: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Walking - raises heart rate without too much stress</li>
        <li>Yoga - associated with better self-esteem and motivation</li>
        <li>Other aerobic exercises - low-intensity movement often raises energy levels in productivity and focus</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Tip: try creating an exercise routine for yourself- 10 mins of yoga or stretching in the morning or at night before bed, or even a quick walk after your lunch break can calm you down and bring you to a more stable, clear headspace.</p>

     <h3>2. Diet and Nutrition</h3>
      <p style="font-weight:normal">The food we put into our bodies fuels our brain power. We rely on nutrition and food for certain vitamins, minerals, and our general health to carry out body functions.</p> 
         <ul>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Omega-3 Fatty Acids: really important  for our reasoning, memory, and attention. Low intake of these essential fats can contribute to depression and inflammation in specific brain regions.</p>
           <p>Sources: plant oils, chia seeds, walnuts, and fatty fish.</p>
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Carotenoids (pigments/color in fruits and vegetables): these pigments can slow inflammation that harms the brain.
           </p>
           <p>Sources: leafy greens, bell peppers, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, and many more.</p>
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Vitamins B, C, and E: helps your memory and builds muscles, and stronger muscles means better brain health. Lack of vitamins C and E can lead to risk of memory loss.</p>
           <p>Sources:green leafy vegetables, sunflower seeds, almonds, and more.</p></li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Connection between moon and food: bodies produces serotonin (regulates sleep, appetite, and mood) in gastrointestinal tract which is lined with neurons. These neurons are made up of ‘good’ bacteria which play an important role in our health Bacteria protects our intestinal lining and provides a barrier against toxins. It limits inflammation and improves our absorption of nutrients. Further, it activates neural connection between the gut and the brain. Probiotics are the most common carriers of these ‘good’ bacteria.
           </p>
           <p>Sources: yogurt, fermented foods such as sauerkraut, tempeh, kimchi, miso, kombucha,and some cheese.</p>
           <p>How to improve mood: eat fatty acids, antioxidants, and other vitamins that prevent stress: salmon, kale, garlic, blueberries and olive oil
          </p>
           </li>
           <p>Why processes foods are not the best choice for our brains:
             processed foods are low in fiber and are therefore digested quickly. This can cause spikes in blood sugar which is harmful to our brain health and mood, thus harms our ability to regulate insulin. Refined sugars are triggers for inflammation and stress.
          </p>
          <p style="font-weight:normal">Some of the best brain foods: fatty fish/omega-3 fatty acids, blueberries, turmeric, broccoli, seeds and nuts, dark chocolate/cocoa powder, oranges, eggs, green tea and coffee</p>
           </ul>
      <h4>For Anxiety</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Eat a breakfast that includes protein: helps you feel fuller longer and gives you more energy for your day.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You've heard it before: drink plenty of water. Dehydration affects our mood negatively.</p>
        </li>
        Best anti-anxiety foods: kiwis, dark chocolate, bananas, asparagus, and berries
      </ul>
