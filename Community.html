    <h3>Community and Social Life</h3>
      <p style="font-weight:normal"> Humans thrive from social interaction and more importantly, depend on their relationships and connections with others for emotional wellbeing. It’s important for us to stay socially active and to engage our brains regularly, so that it can develop and grow. </p> 
         <ul>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Brain forms new connections as we gain knowledge and experiences due to Neuroplasticity: the ability of the brain to modify its functional changes due to changes within the body or body's environment.</p>
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Talking to others stimulates and challenges the brain- we need to keep the brain ‘fit’ just as we do with our bodies.
           </p>
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal"><a href="./BrainInteractive.html#parietal-lobe">Parietal lobe</a> takes in outside information and engages our senses. When we perceiving social cues, we listen to what people say and see how they say it. As we engage in more social interactions, we develop the ability to perceive these important cues that impact our own behavior.</p></li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">The <a href="./BrainInteractive.html#temporal-lobe">amygdala</a> regulates strong human emotions, which helps analyze our reaction to others’ behavior.
           </p>
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Interactions are mainly controlled by the <a href="./BrainInteractive.html#prefrontal">prefrontal cortex</a>- the part of the brain responsible for voluntary actions- manages our immediate responses when we are angry or feeling attacked, or when we are affectionate. Another part of the cortex tells us what emotions we are inhibiting due to those actions and without practice of social interaction, we wouldn’t know how to even respond to some actions.
           </p>
           </li>
           <li><p style="font-weight:normal">Strong human relationships and connections make us feel loved and comfort, which our brain likes.
           </p>
           </li>
            </ul>
        <p>Social interaction and relationships are stored and analyzed throughout the brain, meaning that they require several processes in our brain. Therefore, it’s important for us to stay connected to the people who have a positive impact on our lives, so that we can keep all regions of our brain engaged and healthy. </p>
